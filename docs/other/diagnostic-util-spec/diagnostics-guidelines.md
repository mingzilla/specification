# Vector Store Diagnostics Guidelines

## Core Purpose

The vector store diagnostics system exists **solely to help users identify and troubleshoot configuration issues**. It is NOT intended for:
- Performance monitoring
- Operational metrics gathering
- System health checks
- Usage statistics

The diagnostics system should be designed with a singular focus: **making it immediately clear to users why their configuration isn't working and how to fix it**.

## Key Principles

1. **Configuration-Centric**: Focus exclusively on capturing and reporting configuration parameters and their validation status.

2. **Error Clarity**: Errors should clearly connect the specific configuration parameter that's incorrect with the resulting error.

3. **Actionable Guidance**: Every error should be accompanied by specific, concrete steps users can take to fix the issue.

4. **Minimal Overhead**: Diagnostics should add minimal performance impact and should be completely optional.

5. **Focused Scope**: Only capture information directly related to setup and configuration issues.

## What to Include

### 1. Configuration Parameters
- Record all externally provided configuration values (with sensitive data masked)
- Include default values that were applied when options weren't specified
- Show derived or calculated configuration values

### 2. Connection Attempts
- Record connection attempts to external services
- Capture connection errors with clear correlation to configuration parameters
- Highlight authentication or access issues

### 3. Error Context
- Capture the specific operation that failed
- Record only the first occurrence of each unique error type
- Include configuration context with each error

### 4. Troubleshooting Recommendations
- Provide specific, actionable guidance for each error type
- List steps in order of likelihood to resolve the issue
- Include links to documentation when appropriate

## What to Avoid

### 1. Performance Metrics
- Do not track timing statistics (min/avg/max)
- Avoid recording operation counts or frequencies
- Skip detailed performance analysis

### 2. Operational Data
- Do not log regular operation successes
- Avoid tracking usage patterns or volume
- Skip tracking of non-configuration-related errors

### 3. Excessive Detail
- Avoid detailed timing breakdowns
- Don't track individual operation successes
- Skip internal state reporting unrelated to configuration

## Diagnostic Output Format

Diagnostic output should be structured in this order:

1. **Configuration Summary**
   - All configuration parameters with sensitive data masked
   - Highlight any non-default or unusual settings

2. **Connection Status**
   - Connection results for each external dependency
   - Authentication status

3. **Error Summary**
   - List of unique configuration errors encountered
   - Each with clear connection to specific configuration parameter(s)

4. **Troubleshooting Steps**
   - Specific, actionable recommendations for each error
   - Steps should be concrete (e.g., "Verify your API key" not "Check authentication")

## Implementation Guidelines

### Enabling/Disabling
- Diagnostics should be disabled by default
- Provide simple enable/disable toggle
- Allow clearing diagnostic data

### Error Capture
- Group similar errors together (don't repeat the same error)
- For each error type, capture:
  - First occurrence timestamp
  - Related configuration parameter(s)
  - Clear description of what went wrong
  - Concrete troubleshooting steps

### API Design
- Keep the API simple with minimal methods
- Focus on recording configuration and errors
- Avoid methods for detailed metrics

### Sample Methods
- `recordConfiguration(String component, Map<String, String> params)`
- `recordConnectionAttempt(String endpoint, boolean success, String errorMessage)`
- `recordConfigurationError(String component, String parameter, String error, List<String> fixSteps)`

## Example Diagnostic Report

```
Vector Store Configuration Diagnostics
--------------------------------------

Configuration:
- Embedding Model: nomic-embed-text
- Embedding Service URL: http://localhost:11434/api/embeddings [UNREACHABLE]
- Vector Store URL: http://localhost:6333 [OK]
- Collection Name: vector_store

Errors Detected:
[ERROR] Embedding Service Connection Failed
- Parameter: Embedding Service URL (http://localhost:11434/api/embeddings)
- Error: Connection refused
- Timestamp: 2023-06-15T14:32:05Z

Troubleshooting Steps:
1. Verify the Ollama service is running on localhost port 11434
2. Check network connectivity to the embedding service
3. Ensure the embedding model "nomic-embed-text" is downloaded in Ollama
4. If using Docker, check that the container ports are properly mapped

Status: CONFIGURATION ERROR - Embedding Service Unreachable
```

## Additional Notes

1. **Mask Sensitive Data**: Always mask API keys, passwords, and authentication tokens in diagnostics output.

2. **Human-Readable**: Diagnostic output should be human-readable without requiring additional tools.

3. **Non-Invasive**: Diagnostic code should not affect normal operation when disabled.

4. **Self-Contained**: Avoid dependencies on external services for diagnostics.

By focusing strictly on configuration troubleshooting, this diagnostics approach helps users quickly identify and fix setup issues without the overhead and complexity of a full monitoring system.
