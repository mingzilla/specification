# Vector Database Deployment Architecture Analysis

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation**: The dedicated per-customer deployment model offers the most favorable balance of operational simplicity, security, and reliability.

While shared services appear to offer resource efficiency, this analysis shows that dedicated deployments significantly reduce operational complexity, security risks, and maintenance overhead. The modest increase in resource consumption is substantially outweighed by reduced operational burden, simpler troubleshooting, stronger security isolation, and elimination of cross-customer impacts.

Key benefits of dedicated deployment:
- Simplified security model primarily using network isolation with optional token verification via reverse proxy
- Elimination of complex token management systems for multi-tenant deployments
- Complete isolation preventing cross-customer impacts during outages
- Reduced attack surface and simplified security posture
- Straightforward scaling, backup, and recovery processes

## Overview

This analysis evaluates deployment options for our vector database system used in the AI Copilot feature. The document covers:

- Architectural comparison of shared vs. dedicated deployment models
- Cost analysis (infrastructure and operational labor)
- Security and performance implications
- Implementation requirements for each approach
- Risk assessment and operational complexity considerations

This document shows three primary deployment architectures:
1. **Fully Shared Services**: Single embedding service and vector database serving all customers
2. **Hybrid Approach**: Shared embedding service with dedicated vector databases per customer
3. **Fully Dedicated Services**: Separate embedding and vector database instances per customer

## Security Layer Implementation

The system architecture includes a layered security approach:

| Factor | Network Isolation Only | Network Isolation + Reverse Proxy Token Verification |
|--------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Security Mechanism** | VPC and subnet isolation | VPC and subnet isolation |
| **Secondary Security** | None | Token verification through reverse proxy |
| **Configuration** | Simple network rules | Network rules + reverse proxy configuration + tokens |
| **Purpose** | Prevent unauthorized access | Added protection against misconfiguration |
| **Operational Impact** | Minimal | Moderate (reverse proxy configuration and token management) |

Both Ollama embedding service and Qdrant vector database can have token verification implemented through a reverse proxy:

- **Implementation**: Authentication handled entirely by the reverse proxy, not by the services themselves
- **Token Handling**: `VectorStoreConfig` supplies tokens that will be sent with requests to both services
- **Library Support**: The library will include these tokens in the appropriate headers when making requests

The token verification layer provides an additional security measure beyond network isolation, which can protect services if cloud configuration mistakes occur.

## Conclusion

The analysis demonstrates significant differences in operational complexity, security posture, and long-term maintenance requirements between shared and dedicated architectural approaches.

While shared services offer some resource efficiency benefits, these advantages are outweighed by substantial increases in:

1. Authentication and security infrastructure requirements
2. Operational complexity for token management
3. Cross-tenant isolation challenges
4. Increased risk surface area
5. More complex troubleshooting and debugging

The dedicated service approach, while consuming slightly more resources due to idle capacity, dramatically simplifies the security model, operational procedures, and failure isolation. The reduction in configuration complexity alone significantly decreases the risk of security or operational incidents.

The design allows for optional token verification via a reverse proxy as a defense-in-depth measure without significantly complicating the deployment model. This provides an additional safeguard against potential cloud configuration mistakes while maintaining network isolation as the primary security mechanism.

For organizations with limited operational resources to dedicate to security infrastructure and token management, the slight increase in infrastructure costs for dedicated deployments is substantially offset by reduced operational overhead and risk exposure.
